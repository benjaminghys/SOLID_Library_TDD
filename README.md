# Library Exercise

Welcome to the **Library Management System**! This project is a solution to an exercise focused on applying **SOLID design principles** and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** to build a simple, functional library system.

## ðŸ“š Overview

This Library Management System supports the following basic operations:
1. Adding books to the library.
2. Borrowing books.
3. Returning books.
4. Checking book availability.

Each feature is designed with **single responsibility** principles in mind, and the system is modular to allow easy extensions in the future.

## ðŸ”§ Features

### 1. Add Books
Add books with essential information like title, author, and unique ISBN.

### 2. Borrow Books
A book can only be borrowed if it is available. Once borrowed, it becomes unavailable until returned.

### 3. Return Books
Return a borrowed book to make it available again for others.

### 4. Check Availability
